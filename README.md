# Euclidian geometry on Lean

The initial goal of this repository was to develop a Lean4 formalization of Euclidean geometry, guided by the Hilbert Axioms as presented in Hartshorne's book Geometry: Euclid and Beyond. The primary objectives are to formalize the Hilbert Axioms and the theorems in Chapter 3. Additionally, we aim to formalize the nine-point theorem.
